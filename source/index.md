# Introduction

Utensils provides a rich set of design pattern abstractions for web application development.

Most modern web applications perform similar types of operations, but there is a significant lack of structure for those operations in the JavaScript environment. This library is meant to provide a toolkit of opinionated, useful, and interoperable components to make common tasks in JavaScript web applications quick and easy.

# Installation

Utensils is available on npm as a package:

$ `npm install utensils`

And on bower as a component:

$ `bower install utensils`
